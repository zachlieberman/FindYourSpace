# FindYourSpace
A prototype of a potential system to find find and reserve study spaces at the University of Virginia. 
Contains multiple GUI components.

Center of the screen contains a set of tables in a 2x5 grid. 
    Each table has an associated letter number combination (i.e. A2) that can be typed into the bottom text box.
    After typing in the table, there are three choices: Book, Reserve for 10 minutes, and Sign Out.
        Book: Turns the table RED showing that it is taken.
        Reserve for 10 minutes: Right now, it turns the table YELLOW but the time feature has not been implemented yet.
        Signout: Turns the table back from RED or YELLOW to GREEN again.
        
Left side of screen has radio buttons to switch to different common study spaces for First-Year Students.
